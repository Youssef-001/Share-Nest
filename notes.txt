app.get('/folder/*')
// get an array with all folders and give it to controller to get the data of the last nested folder
// Handle create nested folder first
- page for All folders where user can create parent level folders
- Step one will be to handle route to view all folders, app.get('/folders');

- Edit <form id="create-folder-form" method="POST" action="/create-folder"> in folders.ejs to recieve tree of parent folders after create-folder
then handle the folder creation, now you can tell where you are creating that folder from.
