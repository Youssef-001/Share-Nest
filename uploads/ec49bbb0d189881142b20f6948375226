Here’s a random story excerpt you can use:

Title: The Last Light

In the forgotten corners of the city, where the streets twisted like an ancient puzzle and the wind whispered secrets of a time long past, there stood a lighthouse. Not on a coast, nor by the sea, but in the heart of a decaying metropolis. Its light had once guided ships safely to harbor, but now it served no one. The city had forgotten its purpose, lost to the shadows of progress and technology.

But there was one who remembered—Elara. She was a keeper of stories, a collector of the forgotten, and every night, she would climb the spiral staircase of the lighthouse, oil the rusted gears, and keep the flame alive.

She didn’t know why she did it. There were no ships to guide. No travelers to guide. But the light, in all its faded glory, seemed to call to her. She had heard the stories of its origins from her grandmother, tales of a time when it stood proudly over the waters, a beacon of hope in the storm.

One evening, as Elara reached the top of the tower, something was different. The wind howled, as if in anticipation. The flame flickered, struggling against the gusts. Then, just as the sun dipped below the horizon, the light burst back to life, stronger than it had been in years.

From the darkness, a figure emerged—a traveler, as ancient as the lighthouse itself.

"I’ve come," they whispered, their voice carrying across the wind, "to see if the light still burns."
